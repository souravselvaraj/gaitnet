"""Observation terms. Each builds on `gaitnet_core`, so the simulator and the deployment
runtime compute the same quantities.

Groups (see `env_cfg.ObservationsCfg`): `state` (the robot state vector, features chosen by
name), `candidates` (the footholds the policy scores this tick), and, when a preset turns
them on, `terrain` (per-leg height patches, for networks that read them), `privileged`
(sim-only inputs for the critic) and `base_command` (the command before any nudge, for
feedback observers). Candidates are an observation so the RL library stores them with the
step and can recompute log-probabilities on exactly the set the action was drawn from.

The policy's groups read the action term's `planner_observation()`, which carries the
observation noise; privileged terms read the truth.
