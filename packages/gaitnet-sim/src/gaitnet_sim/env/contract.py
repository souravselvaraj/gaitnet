"""The parts of the planner's contract that the environment has to agree on: which robot,
the foothold grid the terrain is scanned on, and the foothold rules. A trained policy's
bundle records the same values, see `gaitnet_core.bundle`.

Terms read these from `env.cfg.gaitnet` at run time rather than through their own
params, so one override changes every term. The foothold scanners' ray patterns are built
from the default grid when the scene cfg is created; a different grid needs scanners to
match (see `gaitnet_sim.env.scene.foothold_scanner_cfg`), and `RobotIO` checks that they do.
