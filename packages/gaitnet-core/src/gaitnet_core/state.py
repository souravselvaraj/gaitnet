"""What the planner observes. The simulator and the real robot both fill these.

Frames:
- base frame: attached to the trunk, x forward, y left, z up.
- yaw frame: origin at the base (or at a hip, where noted), rotated with the base's
  yaw only, so z is true vertical height.

All tensors are batched over robots (first dimension N) and legs are FL, FR, RL, RR.
